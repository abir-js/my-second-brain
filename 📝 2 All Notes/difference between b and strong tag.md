## ✅ `<b>` (Bold)

- Makes text **visually bold**
    
- **No extra meaning** (only styling)
    
- Used when you just want bold look
    

📌 Example:

```html
<p>This is <b>bold</b> text.</p>
```

## ✅ `<strong>` (Strong Importance)

- Makes text **bold by default**
    
- Also adds **semantic meaning** → “this is important”
    
- Screen readers may **give emphasis** while reading it
    
- Better for **SEO + accessibility**
    

📌 Example:

```html
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Do not share your password.</p>
```

## ⭐ Main Difference (1 line)

👉 **`<b>` = bold look only**  
👉 **`<strong>` = bold + important meaning**

---

### Best Practice

✅ Use `<strong>` when the text is **important**  
✅ Use `<b>` when you only want **styling** (like highlighting keywords)

If you want, I can also explain **`<i>` vs `<em>`** similarly.
