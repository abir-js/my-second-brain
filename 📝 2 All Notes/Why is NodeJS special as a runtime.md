# Why Node.JS is special as a runtime?

### V8 engine:
Node.js uses Google Chrome's V8 engine to compile JavaScript into machine code, making it lightning fast.

### Built in APIs: 
Node.js comes with built-in APIs (like fs for file systems or http for servers) so you can build powerful applications without extra libraries.
