# What is Title?


| Interface                              | Class                            |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| We can't create object of an Interface | We can create object of a class. |
| Interface is like blueprint of a class | class is blueprint of objects    |

```java
class ABC implements XYZ{
	void add() {
		
	}
}
```
