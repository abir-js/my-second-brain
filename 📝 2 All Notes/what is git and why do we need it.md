## Why Git?

### 1. Pendrive approach

- Suppose we are creating a project and it grows overtime.
- Taking help from another person for a feature.
- Use a pen-drive 

#### Problems: 

1. Syncing problem, at a time single developer can work.
2. No collaboration.
3. 2 different repo exists.
4. with more difficult it becomes more confusing.

### 2. Code tracking system 

- Its a software.
- Install it on any device maybe on pendrive and whenever someone changes it stores who is changing and what is he changing.

#### Problem

- Still o collaboration

### 3. A central code tracker server

- Now instead of pendrive, we will treat the server as the single source of truth.
- We are installing our [[#2. Code tracking system | code tracking system]] on our server
- Everyone can work on same project at a same time.

---
### **Summary**

- Here the code tracking software is Git and the server is GitHub.
- Github is the server which hosts Git
- There are many servers like BitBucket, GitLab, GitTea.
- You can buy a server and install git in it.
