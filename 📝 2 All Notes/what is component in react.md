# What is Component?

- Components are independent & reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JS functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

### Creating a Component

```jsx
function Title() {
	return (
		<h1>Hello World!</h1>
	)
}
```

### Rendering Component

```jsx
<Title></Title>
{/* or */}
<Title/>
```
