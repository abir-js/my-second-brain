# What is LangChain?

LangChain is an open source framework with a pre-built agent architecture and integrations for any model or tool — so you can build agents that adapt as fast as the ecosystem evolves

## Why we need LangChain

1. load pdf code
2. create chunk of pdf
3. create vector for chunks
4. store in vector db

- **LangChain** provides utilities functions for all these tasks.
