# Time and Space Complexity

## 1. Order Complexity Analysis

- Amount of **Space or Time** taken up by an algorithm/code as function of input size.
- Not the actual time taken.

## 2. What is Time Complexity

>It is the total time taken by an algorithm to run as a function  of the length of the input.

| Properties        | Old Machine | New Machine  |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| **Time Function** | $time = n$  | $time = n/2$ |
| **Type**          | Linear      | Linear       |
> NOTE
> n can be $n/2$, $log(n)$, $n^2$ etc.


## Types of Time Complexity

### 1. Best Case

#### Big(O)

### 2. Average Case

#### Omega (Ω)

### 3, Worst Case

#### Theta (θ)

| Best Case | Avera |
