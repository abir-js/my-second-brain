# What are parallel routes?

- Parallel routes let you render multiple pages or layouts at the same time, side by side inside one layout
- You define **Slots** where different routes will render.
- Each slot can have its own navigation, state, even be conditionally show hide.

![[parallel-routes]]


1. Shows multiple sections together
2. Independent Navigation (switch panel without refreshing others)
3. Better UX - Fells like multi pain application
