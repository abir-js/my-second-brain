## 🔧 **Library**

> **You call the library.**  
> It provides specific functions or tools that **you use when needed**.

- **You’re in control** of the flow.
    
- Example: You call `lodash`, `jQuery`, or `axios` when you want something done.
    

✅ Think of it like using a toolbox — **you pick the tool** and use it when and how you want.

### 🏗️ **Framework**

> **The framework calls you.**  
> It gives you a **structure** and controls the flow of your app.

- **It’s in control**, and you fill in the blanks (like defining routes, models, etc.)
    
- Example: `Express`, `React`, `Angular`, `Django`
    

✅ Think of it like building a house from a template — **the structure is fixed**, and you just decide where to put things.

|Flexibility|More flexible|More structured|
|Example|`lodash`, `axios`, `moment.js`|`Express`, `React`, `Angular`, `Next.js`|
