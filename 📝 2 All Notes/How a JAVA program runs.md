# What is Title?

A Java program runs through a clear pipeline:

1. Source Code is written in `.java` files.
2. Compilation transforms it into platform-independent bytecode (`.class`).
3. Execution is handled by the JVM, which interprets or compiles the `bytecode into native code` for the specific operating system and hardware, allowing the program to run seamlessly across different environments.
