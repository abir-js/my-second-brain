# What is JRE?

The Java Runtime Environment is what's needed to run java applications on a computer. It consists of:

1. The [[What is JVM | Java Virtual Machine (JVM)]]
2. Compiled Core Classes (Like string, Integer, ArrayList, etc) and supporting files (Configuration files that tell Java how to run)
3. No development tools (unlike JDK) - it's meant for end users who just want to run Java Applications.
4. JRE (Java Runtime Environment) can be installed without JDK (Java Development Kit) since JRE is only needed to run Java applications, while JDK is needed to develop them.
