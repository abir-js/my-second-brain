# What is Title?

```bash
JDK 
├── Development Tools (javac, etc.) 
├── Source Code 
└── JRE 
	├── JVM 
	├── Core Classes (compiled) 
	└── Supporting Files
```

To summarize their relationship:
- JDK contains JRE, which contains JVM
- Developers need JDK to create Java applications
- End users only need JRE to run Java applications
- JVM is the actual engine that runs the Java bytecode on an platform
