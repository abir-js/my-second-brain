# What is Title?

- In **Mongoose**, a **schema** is a blueprint or structure that defines how your documents (objects) will be stored in a **MongoDB** collection. You use it to define the **shape of data**, including the field names, types, validations, and defaults.

```js
import mongoose from "mongoose";

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({

});

const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);

export default User;
```
