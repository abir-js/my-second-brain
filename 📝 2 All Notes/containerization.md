# What is Containerization?

### 🚀 Containerization (In Short)

**Containerization** is the process of packaging an application along with its dependencies, libraries, and environment settings into a **container** so it can run **consistently across different systems**.

---

### ✅ Key Points:

- Uses tools like **Docker**
    
- Containers are **lightweight**, **portable**, and **isolated**
    
- Solves the “**it works on my machine**” problem
    
- Faster and more efficient than virtual machines
    

---

> **Think of it as putting your app in a sealed, self-sufficient box — so it runs the same anywhere.** ✅
