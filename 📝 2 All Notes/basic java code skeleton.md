```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

- `public` - access modifier
- `static` - lets use function without creating object
- `void` - does not returns anything
- `main` - JDK searcher for this function to run first
- `String args[]` 
	- takes inputs as array of strings as parameter
	- takes important inputs for main function during runtime
	- type is string because we can easily convert it to any datatype
- `System`: A class in java.lang package that provides access to the system, including the console.
	- `out`: An instance of PrintStream class within the System class, representing the console.
		- `println`: A method used to print a line of text to console.
