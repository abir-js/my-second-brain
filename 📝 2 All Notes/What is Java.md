# What is Java?

- Java is an **Object-oriented programming language**.
- Java is known for its **"Write once, Run anywhere"** capability, meaning Java code can run on any platform that has a [[Java Virtual Machine (JVM)]] installed. This platform independence is one of the Java's biggest strengths.
